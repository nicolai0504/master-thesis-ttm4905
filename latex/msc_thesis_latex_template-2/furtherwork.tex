\chapter{Concluding Remarks and Future Work}
\label{chp:furtherwork}
What has been created in this paper is merely a fraction of what is possible with the NetFlow data and D3.js. Further analysis of which information that should be included in the visual presentation could provide solution capable of discovering anomalies not being picked up by current systems. 

\section{Recommendations for Future Work}
\subsection{Further testing}
The data provided from UNINETT was not confirmed to contain any attacks, but showed although that the visual representation of the data revealed similar patterns as discovered trough the current nfdump solution.  Further on the visual solution should be tested up against larger sets of data to prove scalability and the ability to reveal patterns over bigger time slots. 

\subsection{Customized searches}
Kanskje ta med i further work?
As showed in section \ref{sec:ip_spectrum} the commands in nfdump can reveal detailed information in few commands, but there is still a few searches that is required to obtain the requested data. By creating an \gls{api} that simplifies the extraction of the information used in the visual elements, the possibility to display live NetFlow data is obtainable.
